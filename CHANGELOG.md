## [0.5.0] — 2026-03-27

### Added
- Usage tracking — inject and copy both increment a `useCount` on each prompt

- "★ Top" virtual tab — appears after first use; shows the 5 most-used prompts
- Usage nudge in UpgradeModal — displays total use count to reinforce upgrade value

## [0.4.0] — 2026-03-27

### Added
- Pin prompts — star icon on each card; pinned prompts always sort to the top (shown with violet border)
- Sort controls — dropdown in search bar to sort by Newest, Oldest, A→Z, Z→A
- Tags — comma-separated tags on prompts; displayed as clickable chips that filter the list via search
- Manage Categories modal — add, rename, and delete categories from the ✎ button next to the category tabs; deleting a category re-assigns its prompts to the next available one
